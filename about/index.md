<div class="about">
    <p>A frontliner and an officer in Power Plant</p>

            <li>
                If you are Indonesian, you know that the electricity for our nation is provided only by PT PLN. I have been proud to be one of them once. I served my country in the maintenance team of <a href="https://www.indonesiapower.co.id"><strong>PT. Indonesia Power</strong></a>, a subsidiary of PLN, as an electrical technician. Performed preventive and corrective maintenance of a variety of assets, equipment, and electrical machinery to ensure power supply meet the demands.

            <li>
                Working as frontliner gave me a solid foundation when my role changed into Procurement officer. It helped me to perform due diligent analysis to ensure that the contracts and negotiations I made for Organization had value for money. And it's part of Supply Chain Management strategy to quickly deliver products to end-users with reduced expenses.

                Have you ever flown with <a href="http://www.lionair.co.id"><strong>Lionair</strong></a>? Back years ago, I was one of many who did engineering tasks to comply with company safety policy, ATA standards, and regulations, especialy in electrical and avionics issues. That's the time when I had frequent flights.  I went from airport to airport to perform my job on aircraft such as retrieving flight data records, updating new firmware and testing the equipment, collect technical data, etc. Everything should be done carefully and well organized to meet its safety standard. Safety in aviation industry must be number one priority.

        <ul>
            <li>
                My very first professional job was production technician in <a href="https://www.sampoerna.com/sampoerna/en/overview"><strong>PT HM Sampoerna Tbk</strong></a>. I operated cigarette maker and filter maker machine. At that time, I learned how to work in the manufacturing industry which has its machine running 24hours, eight hours based, teams spend a week on each, with a night, afternoon, morning progression over the weekly cycle. And it's my very first time to see how mechanical counter works as well as electronic counter does. Mechatronics is cool!
